## Overview
This report summarizes the machine learning pipeline for predicting diamond `cut` using the `ggplot2::diamonds` dataset. The pipeline is built with `{targets}` for reproducibility.

## Model Performance
```{r}
library(targets)
tar_read(model_metrics)
```

## Confusion Matrices
```{r}
tar_read(conf_plot)
```

## Feature Importance (Random Forest)
```{r}
tar_read(importance_plot)
```

## Conclusion
The random forest model typically outperforms logistic regression due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships. Key predictors include `carat`, `color`, and `clarity`.
